        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These rich and creamy mashed potatoes are a staple with my family.
            They are easy to make and are a great accompanyment to almost every protein.

        <p>
            This recipe, much like most of my other dishes, doesn't followed
            set amounts, but is instead subject to taste.  With that being said,
            I usually make my batches with a 5 lbs bag of russet potatoes.
